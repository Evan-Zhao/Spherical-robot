# Spherical Robot

Spherical robot is an SJTU IPP project hosted by a team of five, with the assistance of SJTU and Intel.

Its software is the combination of two algorithms: robot locomotion and sound localization. Various data transmission tasks in the robot are also involved.

This repo is mainly the sound localization branch, starting from micarray driver and terminating at data emission through WiFi.
